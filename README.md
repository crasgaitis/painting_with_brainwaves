# üß† Painting with Brainwaves
### üë©‚Äçüè´ Synaptech demo
Discover the secrets inside your brain as we track its electrical activity in real time, translate it into meaningful patterns, and use it to create stunning art. Then, test your knowledge in a friendly competition for a chance to win some cool prizes!

Synaptech is a neuroengineering focused RSO, welcome to any and all majors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions to run app
1. Turn on your Muse device.
2. Open Petal Metics and start the LSL stream.
3. Run the Julia fractals visualizations by running app.py.
4. Run the DALL E visualizations by running app2.py.
5. Try changing the way the art is generated. Consider changing the way fractals/colors are generated for Julia fractals, or how the original prompt is incorporating brainwave data for DALL E. 
6. Don't forget to share your observations and artwork in the Padlet!

Another cool site to play around with is [eegedu.com](https://eegedu.com/). You do not need a 3rd party application (like Petal) to try this!
